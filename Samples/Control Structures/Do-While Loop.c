|*                                      ROBOTC on VEX 2.0 CORTEX                                      *|
|*                                                                                                    *|
|*  This program uses a "do-while" loop to instruct your robot to traverse a square 5 times by        *|
|*  repeating moving forward and turning behaviors 20 times.                                          *|
|*  There is a two second pause at the beginning of the program.                                      *|
|*                                                                                                    *|

|*    NOTES:                                                                                          *|
|*    1)  Reversing 'rightMotor' (port 2) in the "Motors and Sensors Setup" is needed with the        *|
|*        "Squarebot" mode, but may not be needed for all robot configurations.                       *|
|*    2)  When using "do-while" loops, the code between its braces is always run at least once,       *|
|*        since the condition is not checked until after it is run.                                   *|
|*    3)  The integer variable 'i' is needed to keep track of the number of times that the            *|
|*        "do-while" loop has run.                                                                    *|
|*                                                                                                    *|
