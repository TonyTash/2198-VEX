|*                                                                                                    *|
|*  This program uses a "while" loop to instruct the robot to traverse a square 5 times by repeating  *|
|*  moving forward and turning behaviors 20 times.                                                    *|
|*  There is a two second pause at the beginning of the program.                                      *|
|*                                                                                                    *|

|*    1)  Reversing 'rightMotor' (port 2) in the "Motors and Sensors Setup" is needed with the        *|
|*        "Squarebot" mode, but may not be needed for all robot configurations.                       *|
|*    2)  A "while" loop checks the condition (the code following 'while' between the parenthesis)    *|
|*        each time before the code inside of the braces is run                                       *|
|*        (or skipped, if conditions are not met).                                                    *|
|*    3)  The integer variable 'i' is needed to keep track of the number of times that the "while"    *|
|*        loop has run.                                                                               *|
|*                                                                                                    *|
