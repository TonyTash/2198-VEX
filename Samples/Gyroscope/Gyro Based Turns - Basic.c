Gyro Based Turns - Basic
-This program instructs your robot to turn for the specified number of degrees in "degrees10".
-For best sensor results, clear out the gyro and manually configure it at the begging of the code.
-The Gyro is configured by default to provide values from 0 to -3600 for clockwise rotation,
 and 0 to 3600 for counter-clockwise rotation
