|*    1)  Reversing 'rightMotor' (port 2) in the "Motors and Sensors Setup" is needed with the        *|
|*        "Squarebot" mode, but may not be needed for all robot configurations.                       *|
|*    2)  The Ultrasonic Sensor returns a value of '-1' when it is out of range from the nearest      *|
|*        object.  The range is from 0 to 255 inches, so make sure that the robot is within this      *|
|*        range or it may never run.                                                                  *|
