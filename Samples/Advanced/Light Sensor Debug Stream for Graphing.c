Light Sensor Debug Stream for Graphing
- This program outputs the value of a VEX Ambient Light sensor 10x a second to the ROBOTC Debug Stream
  Debugger window, until a touch sensor is pressed. The data created by the program can be copied
  from the Debug Stream and pasted into Office Excel or OpenOffice Calc and graphed for analysis.
- The Debug Stream Debugger window can be found by selecting Window > Menu Level > Expert / Super User.
- This method will work for sampling data from any of the sensors!
